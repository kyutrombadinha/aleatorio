Remember that spiders are more afraid of you, than you are of them.
Smile and the world smiles with you. Frown and you're on your own.
Don't eat non-snow-coloured snow.
Cars are bad investments.
If you have the chance, take it!
Never cut your own fringe.
Make choices and dont look back.
Happiness is a journey, not a destination.
True happiness always resides in the quest.
Never pay full price for a sofa at DFS.
